### Description
The general idea for this proyect is to have an automatic way of parsing clothing brand's websites and display all sold items in a single website that allows for easy grouping and comparison by value, type, etc.

### Limitations
Only supports sites built with tiendanube for now.

### Upcoming plans:
- automate data updates (ex. new items, change in prices)
- support shopify sites
