## Usage

1. `npm install`
2. Run main script to add products to the db (a json file for now, accepts duplicates):
   2.1. For single page product discovery: `npm run start {your_tiendanube_url(ex.https://www.peppersarg.com)}`
   2.2. For multi page product discovery: `npm run start {your_tiendanube_urls_txt_file(ex.example_multi_page.txt)}`

This currently expects an api for a site created with tiendanube.
